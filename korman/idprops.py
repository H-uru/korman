    So, here's the rub.

    In Blender 2.79, we finally get the ability to use native Blender ID Datablock properties in Python.
    This is great! It will allow us to specify other objects (Blender Objects, Materials, Textures) in
    our plugin as pointer properties. Further, we can even specify a poll method to create a 'search list'
    of valid options.

    Naturally, there are some cons. The con here is that we've been storing object NAMES in string properties
    for several releases now. Therefore, the purpose of this class is simple... It is a mixin to be
    used for silently upgrading these object name properties to ID Properties. You will need to override
    the _idprop_mapping and _idprop_sources methods in your class. The mixin will handle upgrading
    the properties when a derived class is touched.

    Unfortunately, it is not possible to easily batch convert everything on load or save, due to issues
    in the way Blender's Python API functions. Long story short: PropertyGroups do not execute __new__
    or __init__. Furthermore, Blender's UI does not appreciate having ID Datablocks return from
    __getattribute__. To make matters worse, all properties are locked in a read-only state during
    the UI draw stage.

        # I have some bad news for you... Unfortunately, this might have been called
        # during Blender's draw() context. Blender locks all properties during the draw loop.
        # HOWEVER!!! There is a solution. Upon inspection of the Blender source code, however, it
        # appears this restriction is temporarily suppressed during property getters... So let's get
        # a property that executes a getter :D
